dart — Dart & Flutter snippets

Purpose
- Tiny Dart/Flutter examples for learning and experimentation.

Quick start — examples in this folder
- Run the simple Dart example:
  - `dart run dart/eg.dart`
- Flutter-late examples are present as sources (`egFlutterlate.dart`) — open these in a Flutter project or copy into a Flutter app for testing.

Notable files
- `eg.dart` — Dart example (console)
- `egDartlate.dart`, `egFlutterlate.dart` — experimental/ported snippets
- `dart.README` — historical notes

Dependencies
- Dart SDK (match local `dart --version` to the example's assumptions).

Quick contributor checklist ✅
- State the required SDK version and a one-line run command.
- Add example input and expected output where applicable.

See: `../.github/copilot-instructions.md` for repository standards.
