## SCAFFOLDING REQUIREMENTS SUMMARY

### Critical Heights for Scaffolding
- **Ridge height:** RL 34.445 (9.6m above lowest site level)
- **Maximum building height for staging:** ~14-15m (including roof peak access)
- **Primary work area (upper floor):** CL 31.900 – 32.200
- **Lower roof work area:** CL 26.850 – 31.900

### Access Points

## NOTES FOR ITERATION

**Items to verify/clarify:**
- [ ] Exact building length measurement (approx 33.5m from drawing)
- [ ] Building width perpendicular to sections (approx 12-14m)
- [ ] Roof pitch angle (estimate ~20-25° from yellow profile)
- [ ] Deck depth (approx 3.5m)
- [ ] Pool dimensions (not clearly labeled, estimate ~6m × 5m)
- [ ] Exact parapet heights at different sections
- [ ] Staircase locations & heights (visible in drawing but not labeled)

**Accuracy Level:** Medium (extracted from section drawings at 1:100 scale; some dimensions estimated from proportions)
