This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

Prompt
  "Build me a flight lookup nextjs web app where the user can put in a flight number and the app gives you the start time, end time, time zones, start location, and end location of the flight. For now, use a mock API that returns a list of matching flights. Display the search results under the form input"


 Initial antigravity UI is hideous, Prashant did same using loveable UI (beautiful) will try Antigravity again in a month or so

## How to save assistant responses ✅
Short, practical options you can use right now — choose one and the assistant can do it for you.

- **Paste into the open editor** (fastest)
  - Paste (Cmd+V) → Save (Cmd+S).
- **Append from the terminal**
  - Append using a heredoc:
    ```bash
    cat >> pumped-scripts/test-apps/AntiGravity/flight-recorder/README.md <<'MD'
    Your saved text here
    MD
    ```
  - Or write a file directly:
    ```bash
    printf '%s
' "My note line 1" "My note line 2" > docs/assistant-note.md
    ```
- **Copy to macOS clipboard**
  - Pipe text into clipboard: `pbcopy <<< "PASTE_HERE"`
- **Save + version with git**
  - git add <file> && git commit -m "docs: add assistant-saved note" && git push origin <branch>
- **Ask the assistant to insert it**
  - Choose the editor `Edit` option and tell me where to insert (append / replace / under a heading) — I will add it and show a preview.

> ⚠️ Tip: confirm whether you want the text committed before I create a git commit or PR.
