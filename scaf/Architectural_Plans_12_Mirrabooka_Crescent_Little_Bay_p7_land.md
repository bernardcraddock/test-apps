## **1. Overview**

This page contains **two architectural building sections** through the dwelling at **12 Mirrabooka Crescent, Little Bay**, showing:

- roof forms and maximum building height  
- floor levels (FL) and ceiling levels (CL)  
- pool, deck, cabana, driveway, and under‑deck tank  
- structural elements (r.c. slab, block walls, piers, beams)  
- stormwater and DA compliance notes  
- internal room relationships  
- site levels and boundary conditions  

These sections illustrate how the building steps down the sloping site and how internal spaces relate to external areas such as the pool and deck.

## **2. Key Dimensions & Height Controls**

### **2.1 Maximum Building Height**
- **9.5 m maximum height limit** (DA control)
- **Ridge level:** RL **34.445**

## **3. Floor Levels (FL) & Ceiling Levels (CL)**

### **Upper Floor**
- **FL 29.650** – main upper floor  
- **CL 29.270** – ceiling over some upper rooms  
- **CL 31.900 / 32.200** – higher ceiling zones under roof forms

The roofscape combines:

- corrugated metal roofing  
- low‑pitch Klip-lok roofing
